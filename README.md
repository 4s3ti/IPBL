# About IPBL

IPBL is an IP blocker script with the intent to minimize the script kiddies and bots brute force attacks impact in ssh and mail servers which often come from a different set of IP addresses making them hard to stop with some of the most known and available tools. 

# Working Distros

IPBL, as is, should work with any distro, however it as only been tested on Arch Linux.
I will keep this information updated as I test the script in other distros. 

Tested and working: Arch Linux, CentOS, Ubuntu

# Dependencies

To be able to use IPBL script you must have 

ipset ; iptables and wget

# How to install

The install to fully automate the script usage is an objective, however, I will only implement it later. 

To use the script you must install the needed dependencies, using your distro package manager,  download the script, set execute permissions on the script and execute it. 

Then the script will take care of the rest. 

For more detailed information please check the wiki.

# Configs 

There isn't much to config in the script already, but in some cases, you might want to change the behavior of the script. 

please read the Wiki for more details


# Contributions

It's my intent to improve the script and make it useful for as many people as I can. 

If you like the project and want to contribute, feel free to open issues or pull requests with your suggestions or improvements.

Pull requests are going to be merged with the test branch and merged to the main branch after being tested.
